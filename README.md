# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this was to analyze provided PyBer ride sharing data to better understand the correlation between the different fares and city types. providing an easy understanding of this can help improve the affordability of PyBer in certain areas so that potentially its user base grows.
## Results 

- Rural cities, while having the least amount of rides and drivers, have the highest average fare 
- Urban cities provide provide more than 4 times the amount of drivers than suburban but the average fare per driver is less than half
- Rural and suburban cities have a higher rides to drivers ratio and is reflected by higher fares

## Summary: 
Based on the results, I would reccommend that the company attempt to reach more drivers in rural areas to bring down prices and potentially attract more customers. The data reflects that there are many more drivers in urban cities so reaching out to more customers in those areas would be beneficial, its possible that dedicated drivers are losing money due to downtime between rides.
